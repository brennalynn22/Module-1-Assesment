// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a
     definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofRequirements = " What do you need? Understanding the technical requirements needed to solve the problem. Ask who is going ot be using it and why, what type of data will be collected, how will it handlt secruity, does it need to be integrated with other tools"
const design = "what tech will you use, whats the best data base. Not aesthics but the flow and functionality?"
const implementation = "process of configuring software and user training, making sure it meets all requirements both functionality and business needs and agreements"
const testingandIntegration = " testing software in a small group like beta testers or using UX tools to make sure it meets all the technical requirements with the components and subsytems integreated. and then pushing code into production"
const maintain = "maintain the software for the client by updates and fixing bugs or adding new features"
